Search Functionality: Allowing users to search for weather forecasts in specific cities or regions, providing a personalized weather experience.

Responsive Design: Designing a responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, enabling users to access the app from various devices.

Weather Icons: Incorporating weather icons to visually represent different weather conditions, enhancing the app's user experience.

Forecast Visualization: Displaying weather forecasts for the next few days, enabling users to plan their activities accordingly.
